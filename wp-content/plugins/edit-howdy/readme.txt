This plugin allows you to change the "Howdy" message to whatever text message you would like.

== Description ==

**Note: This plugin is no longer being maintained or supported. Download and use at your own risk.**

While the "Howdy" message is suitable for bloggers and casual users of WordPress, it does not fit the bill for many projects requiring WordPress to be used as a true CMS. This simple, lightweight and secure plugin allows you to change "Howdy" to whatever text you would like it to say.
